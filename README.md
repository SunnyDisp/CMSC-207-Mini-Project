### Project Title
CMSC 207 Mini-Project: Build a Personal Web Profile

### Project Overview
This is a simple interactive web-based project that focuses on applying foundational web development concepts taught in Clyde Hatter's Create with Code book. This basic personal web profile reinforce HTML structure, CSS styling, and basic JavaScript interactivity to dynamically update the webpage. This was done as a course requirement for CMSC 207: Web Programming and Development. This basic personal web profile is heavily inspired by the game Stardew Valley and other pixel Role-Playing-Games (RPG).

### Features
* Animation Effects: CSS animation effects were applied in every's section titles.
* Player Switching: Like that of an RPG, the user can toggle between two charactersâ€”an aspiring web developer and an undead sorcerer.
* Interactive Buttons: Includes a "Back", "Switch", and "Start" button that dynamically modify texts and player description.
* Image Swapping: Clicking on specific images toggles between two different pictures.
* Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile and desktop view using media query.

### Technologies Used
* HTML: Structure of the webpage
* CSS: Styling and layout adjustments
* JavaScript: Interactivity and dynamic content updates

* Navigation Bar
* Header
* About Me (Player Loadout) Section
* Hobbies and Interests (Side Quests) Section
* Contact Info (Join Lobby) Section
* Footer

The links in the navigation bar toggles each section except the footer. In the desktop view, the logo (a spinning coin) appears on the left side of the bar and the navigation links appear on the right side. However, the logo is omitted in the mobile view for better responsiveness.

The header contains the page title and subtitle akin to that of an arcade game. There is no interactivity in the header but an animation was employed to the page title. 

The Player Loadout section contains basic information about the developer and a pixilated photo of her. The other character, which can be viewed using the switch button, discourages the user to pick him, so the user doesn't have much choice but to select the main character. The back and start button triggers another message.

The Side Quests section contains three (3) hobbies and interests that the developer likes to do when she's not working or studying. Among the three, it is noticeable that the developers likes video games the most, as evident by the website's appearance.

The Join Lobby section provides the user information on how to connect with the developer. It contains
