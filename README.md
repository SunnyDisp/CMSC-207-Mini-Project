# CMSC-207-Mini-Project

### Project Title
CMSC 207 Mini-Project: Build a Personal Web Profile

### Project Overview
This interactive web-based project applies foundational web development concepts from Clyde Hatter's *Create with Code* book. It reinforces HTML structure, CSS styling, and basic JavaScript interactivity to dynamically updated the webpage. This project was completed as a course requirement for *CMSC 207: Web Programming and Development*. The design is heavily inspired by *Stardew Valley* and other pixel-styles Role-Playing-Games (RPG).

### Features
* Animation Effects: CSS animation effects enhance section titles.
* Player Switching: Users can toggle between two characters—an aspiring web developer and an undead sorcerer, mimicking an RPG character selection.
* Interactive Buttons: *Back*, *Switch*, and *Start* buttons dynamically modify text and player descriptions.
* Image Swapping: Clicking on specific images toggles between two different pictures.
* Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile and desktop view using media queries.

### Technologies Used
* HTML: Defines the structure of webpage
* CSS: Handles styling and layout adjustments
* JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic content updates

### Webpage Structure
The website consists of six sections, each using proper semantic tags:
* Navigation Bar
* Header
* About Me (Player Loadout) Section
* Hobbies and Interests (Side Quests) Section
* Contact Info (Join Lobby) Section
* Footer

The navigation bar allows users to toggle between sections, except for the footer. On desktop view, a spinning coin logo appears on the left, while navigation links are aligned to the right. For better responsiveness, the logo is omitted in mobile view.

The header displays the page title and subtitle, styled to resemble an arcade game. While it does not include interactivity, an animation effect enhances the title.

The Player Loadout section presents basic information about the developer along with a pixelated photo. The alternative character, accessible via the switch button, discourages users from selecting him, leaving the main character as the only viable option. The "Back" and "Start" buttons trigger additional messages.

The Side Quests section highlights three hobbies and interests of the developer. Notably, video games appear to be the most favored, as reflected in the website’s aesthetic.

The Join Lobby section provides contact details, including links to social media profiles, an email address, and a location.

Finally, the footer displays the project name and completion date.
